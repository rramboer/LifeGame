# LifeGame

Inspired by John Conway's Game of Life

This game has a two-dimensional, hexagonal grid with generations of living cells. 
As each new generation forms, if an empty cell has two or three living neighbors, 
it becomes alive. If a living cell has no neighbors or four or more neighbors, it dies.
